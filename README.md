**Contrastive Semi-supervised Learning for 2D medical image segmentation.**
![](images/model.jpg)
### Some filemaps
- attn_unet.py: Code for the backbone/baseline Attention unet
- data_loader.py: Contains data generator for the celiac dataset
- generate_pseudolabels.py: A utility file for generating and saving pseudolabels in case of very slow cpus that cant run on-the-fly
- inference.py: Run inference on a test set of images
- metrics.py: Contains loss functions and metrics to be monitored
- model.py: Defines encoder, decoder, composite model
- main.py: Running semi-supervised CL+CR training and finetuning of the network. Change config variables at the beginning code and run it (python main.py)
- utils.py: Some functional utilities
- dataloaders/data_generator.py: A completely modular implementation of celiac dataset generator. Easily modifiable to other datasets
- FT_generator.py: Contains dataloader for finetuning with Celiac Dataset.

### Requirements
- python 3.6+
- Tensorflow-GPU 2.0+
- Keras (compatible with the TF backend)

### Note
Some training images from our duodenal histopathology dataset some pretrained model weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZXRTOWzMLngGeEpMriaBk7Io7zVY7yx?usp=sharing).
Each file corresponds to the final weights for the model on that dataset which is used for segmentation. celiac_subset file are sample weights of model trained in supervised manner on a subset (50) of labelled samples only.
